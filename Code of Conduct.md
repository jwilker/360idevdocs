__This applies to everyone who attends an event we organize.__

Harassment won't be tolerated at 360|Conferences events. Simple, that's it. You do it, we won't have you back, and we'll ask you to leave. 
We want to be very clear to all attendees, speakers and sponsors of our events, we value your participation, and if something, anything happens during the course of your participation at a 360|Conferences event that makes you uncomfortable, please. __No really, PLEASE make us aware of it__. We can't do anything about it if we never know about it. Or worse we find out after the fact. If you've ever attended a 360|Conferences event, you know we're visible and present the entire time, so you can come to us immediately or send us a message. Any communication we receive regarding an harassment issue will be kept in the strictest of confidence of course.  If anything happens at our events that make people uncomfortable or feel unwelcome at the event or in the community, then we've failed. We hate failure.

__Harassment includes:__ offensive verbal comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, religion, technology choices, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.

Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.

__Sponsors are also subject to the anti-harassment policy__. In particular, sponsors should not use sexualised images, activities, or other material. Booth staff (including volunteers) should not use sexualised clothing/uniforms/costumes, or otherwise create a sexualised environment.
If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the conference organisers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the conference with no refund.

__When we receive a complaint, we'll [handle it.](http://360conferences.com/how-things-are-handled)__
 
By contact, we mean email, even a DM on twitter. Heck weâ€™ll share our phone number with anyone who wants it so they have it just in case. What "make us aware of it" doesn't mean is publicly shaming someone or the event. That never goes well for anyone and escalates a situation that likely doesn't need to be escalated.


__For speakers, regarding your slides:__

As far as we know it's never come up at one of our events, but a good rule of thumb is that if your parents will find one of your slides objectionable, it's probably not a good idea. Does that mean no cussing, fuck no, does that mean no slide of a naked person holding a laptop... yeah it does, and you should know better.

Part of what we think makes our events more enjoyable is a lack of corporate-ness and not feeling like a "big show", so yeah the occasional curse word will be in a session title, and is likely in many presentations. There's a fine line between colorful language and  using foul language just to do it. Our speakers know the difference.

 
__We expect participants to follow these rules at conference and workshop venues and conference-related social events.__
